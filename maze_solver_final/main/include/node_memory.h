 * like normal). If that exit is a dead end, the bot U-turns and arrives back at
 * the node from the exit it took. node_memory_return() then picks the next
 * exit that hasn't been tried (same order: straight, TURN_PREFERENCE, other)
 * and works out which way that is from the bot's new direction.
 *
 * If every exit of the node was tried, the node is dropped and the bot heads
 * back the way it originally came, still "returning", so the node before it
 * gets the same treatment.
 *
 * Exits are stored as seen when the bot first arrived (original direction).

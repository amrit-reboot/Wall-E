/*
 * FOLLOW state: normal PID line following.
 *
 * Every loop it checks, in this order, and hands off to another state if one fires:
 *   1. side branch (junction)  -> APPROACH (state_junction.c), then a 90 degree turn
 *   2. line gone               -> TURN_120 toward a separate side line seen just before
 *                                 (acute exit), U-turn if it was centred (dead end),
 *                                 else SEARCH toward where it was
 *   3. none of the above: PID line following. Curves and 45 degree bends are just followed
 *      (the PID steers round them), no turn state needed
 * (Pink drop zone check is commented out.)
 *
 * Checks 1-3 are skipped (bot drives straight if it sees no line) for START_HOLD_MS
 * at power on and INVERT_HOLD_MS after a colour flip, so the start and the edges of
 * the colour blind block can't look like a junction or a dead end.
